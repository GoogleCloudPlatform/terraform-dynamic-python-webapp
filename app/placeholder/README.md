# Placeholder

This folder is designed to hold a static page that can be deployed to Firebase as a placeholder until the real website is deployed.

Features:

 * replaces the Firebase Hosting "Site Not Found" 404 page with a placeholder
 * page set to automatically refresh every 5 seconds
 * uses embedded image (like the "Site Not Found" does) to prevent image loading flickering.

This placeholder is built in `placeholder-image.cloudbuild.json`, automatically built and deployed using Cloud Build triggers for use in the Jump Start Solution terraform.
